# üéè Wind Turbines Multi-Objective Optimization
In this project we aim to solve a multi objective optimization problem using **Evolutionary Algorithms** and **Swarm Intelligence Optimization**.

üí° We actually found a dataset containing information about the weather in Brasil, [here the reference](https://www.kaggle.com/PROPPG-PPG/hourly-weather-surface-brazil-southeast-region).

Given a certain array of budgets, (for example [ "5,000,000.00$", "12,000,000.00$", "2,000,000.00$" ]), we want to optimize the placement of wind turbines in the Brazil region by considering the following:
- **Power Plant**: transport energy from wind turbines to power plant and from power plant to cities
- **Budget constraint**: it's not possible to spend more money than that
- **Limited types of wind turbines**: there are more than one kind of wind turbines
