# 🎏 Wind Turbines Multi-Objective Optimization
In this project we aim to solve a multi objective optimization problem using **Evolutionary Algorithms** and **Particle Swarm Intelligence Optimization**.
- [x] EA (partially implemented)
- [ ] PSO

#### You have been commissioned by Brazil to find in which city to place wind turbines in order to maximize the **energy production**, plus you have also to decide where to place a **power plant** in order to minimize infrastracture cost 🤯. Will you be able to find the solution for **110 cities** that are very far from each other? 😈

💡 We actually found a dataset containing information about the weather in Brazil, [here the reference](https://www.kaggle.com/PROPPG-PPG/hourly-weather-surface-brazil-southeast-region).

We want to optimize the placement of wind turbines in the Brazil region by considering the following:
- **Power Plant**: transport energy from wind turbines to power plant and from power plant to cities
- **Budget constraint**: it's not possible to spend more money than that
- **Limited types of wind turbines**: there are more than one kind of wind turbines
